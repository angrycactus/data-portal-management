# Data Portal Management Framework

## Purpose of this Guide

Often in Data Portal projects the focus is overwhelmingly on technical aspects, starting with what Data Portal technology to use (e.g CKAN/DKAN/Socrata and so forth) and what technical development work to undertake to customize it to the organizationâ€™s need. There can be a perception that the deploying a Data Portal is a sufficient execution of strategy.

However, a Data Portal is just a tool, and as with most technology, ought to be viewed as a catalyst for what will really have a foundational, long term positive effect - organizational change. 

Rolling out a Data Portal is a small, though important, step along the road to improving your organization by making your data easily findable, searchable and usable for your stakeholders.

Therefore, the purpose of this guide is to support good Data Portal Management practice in Government Agencies, Companies and Organizations by giving you a brief introduction to a few of the other aspects of a wholistic Data Portal Management strategy.
